                At the start of the game, two tiles will be generated
                automatically. If two tiles with the same number collide with
                each other, they will merge into one tile and the number will
                double. Your goal is to use your arrow keys (If you do not know
                where they are, they are beneath the enter key) to slide all
                tiles to one side and make them collide and form 2048. You win
                if 2048 is formed, you lose if there are no more movements
                possible. Try it and you will understand how this works really
                quick.
