          At the start of the game, two tiles will be generrated automatically.
          If two tiles with the same number colide with each other, they will
          merge into one tile and the number will double. Your goal is to use
          your arrow keys (If you do not know where they are, they are beneath
          the enter key) to slide all tiles to one side and make them colide and
          form 2048. You win if 2048 is formed, you lose if there are no more
          movements possible. Try it and your will understand how this works
          really quick.
